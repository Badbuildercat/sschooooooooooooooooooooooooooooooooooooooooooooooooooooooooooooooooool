Do you like butter well i sure hope you do 
becasue i have immensely large qauntitys of 
butter and i need to sell it soon so
i will sell you 200kg of butter for the 
reasonable price of 2$ per kilo but you 
have to figure out how to transport the
butter because once i sell it its not my 
problem. So do we have a deal?
